# Infix to Postfix Expression Converter and Evaluator

This project provides a tool to convert an infix mathematical expression to a postfix expression and evaluate the postfix expression. The main functionality includes parsing the infix expression, handling operator precedence, and evaluating the resultant postfix expression.

## Introduction

Mathematical expressions can be represented in infix notation, where operators are placed between operands (e.g., `3 + 4`). This project converts such infix expressions to postfix notation, where operators follow their operands (e.g., `3 4 +`), and evaluates the postfix expression. This approach is useful in computing environments because it eliminates the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules during evaluation.

## Features

- Convert infix expressions to postfix notation.
- Evaluate postfix expressions.
- Handle various operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`.
- Validate mathematical expressions.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the script, then ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a valid infix expression when prompted.
3. The script will validate the expression, convert it to postfix notation, and display the result.

```bash
python infix_to_postfix.py
```

## Functions

### `is_operator(char)`
Checks if a character is one of the supported operators.

### `precedence(op)`
Returns the precedence level of an operator.

### `infix_to_postfix(expression)`
Converts an infix expression to a postfix expression.

### `evaluate_postfix(postfix)`
Evaluates a postfix expression and returns the result.

### `is_valid_expression(expression)`
Validates an infix expression by attempting to convert and evaluate it.

This project provides a simple yet powerful tool for converting and evaluating mathematical expressions. It can be extended to handle more complex operations or integrated into larger applications requiring mathematical computations.
